# Libraries and technologies used
### UI Layer
- Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
- view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Navigation Fragments : to navigate between the screens.
- Animated Splash screen : using new android Animated Splash Screen Library.
### Logic Layer
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Dagger Hilt Dependency Injection : to inject objects in Modules.
- SOLID principles : for clean code.
- Coroutines : do some code in the background.
- State Flow and Channels : to define the state of the system at the moment.
### Data Layer
- Firebase Authentication : Manging Accounts/ Loging in and Registrations.
- Firebase Firestore : Database for the system.
- Firebase Storage : To store songs images and songs files.

## In Progress
I am working on adding bar-code search for products, adding functionality to track your order location, and adding products that have more recommendations according to your previous orders.
